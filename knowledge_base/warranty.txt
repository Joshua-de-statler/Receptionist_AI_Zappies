Our company provides a 10-year structural warranty on all new custom homes. This covers the foundation and frame of the home. A separate 2-year warranty covers all plumbing and electrical systems. Appliances are covered by their respective manufacturer's warranties. The warranty does not cover cosmetic issues like paint or drywall cracks after the first 90 days.
