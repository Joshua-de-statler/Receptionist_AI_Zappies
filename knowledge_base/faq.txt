Q: What is the typical timeframe to build a custom home?
A: A typical custom home build takes between 10 to 16 months from groundbreaking to completion, depending on the complexity and size of the project.

Q: Do you help with purchasing land?
A: While we do not broker land deals, we partner with a number of trusted local real estate agents and can provide recommendations to help you find the perfect lot for your new home.

Q: What is your price per square foot?
A: We do not use a fixed price per square foot, as every custom home is unique. The final cost depends on the architectural complexity, interior finishes, and specific features chosen by the client. We provide a detailed, itemized budget after the initial design consultation.
